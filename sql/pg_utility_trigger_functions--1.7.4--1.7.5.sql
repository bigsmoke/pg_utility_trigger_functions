# `pg_utility_trigger_functions`

[![PGXN version](https://badge.fury.io/pg/pg_utility_trigger_functions.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/pg/pg_utility_trigger_functions)

The `pg_utility_trigger_functions` PostgreSQL extensions bundles together some
pet trigger functions that the extension
author—[BigSmoke](https://www.bigsmoke.us/)—likes to walk through various
PostgreSQL projects.

Feel free to copy-paste individual functions if you don't want to introduce an
extension dependency into your own extension/project.  Just try to respect the
PostgreSQL license that this extension was released under.

## Authors and contributors

* [Rowan](https://www.bigsmoke.us/) originated this extension in 2022 while
  developing the PostgreSQL backend for the [FlashMQ SaaS MQTT cloud
  broker](https://www.flashmq.com/).  Rowan does not like to see himself as a
  tech person or a tech writer, but, much to his chagrin, [he
  _is_](https://blog.bigsmoke.us/category/technology). Some of his chagrin
  about his disdain for the IT industry he poured into a book: [_Why
  Programming Still Sucks_](https://www.whyprogrammingstillsucks.com/).  Much
  more than a “tech bro”, he identifies as a garden gnome, fairy and ork rolled
  into one, and his passion is really to [regreen and reenchant his
  environment](https://sapienshabitat.com/).  One of his proudest achievements
  is to be the third generation ecological gardener to grow the wild garden
  around his beautiful [family holiday home in the forest of Norg, Drenthe,
  the Netherlands](https://www.schuilplaats-norg.nl/) (available for rent!).
